Test identification
===================

.. todo::

    This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to identify and
    describe each test to which this STP applies.

..
    
.. _generalinfo:

General information
-------------------

.. todo::

    This paragraph shall be divided into subparagraphs to present general
    information applicable to the overall testing to be performed.

..
    
.. _testlevels:

Test levels
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::

    This paragraph shall describe the levels at which testing will be
    performed, for example, CSCI level or system level.

..
    
.. _testclasses:

Test classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::

   This paragraph shall describe the types or classes of tests that will be
   performed (for example, timing tests, erroneous input tests, maximum
   capacity tests).

..

.. _testconditions:

General test conditions
-----------------------

.. todo::

   This paragraph shall describe conditions that apply to all of the tests or
   to a group of tests. For example: "Each test shall include nominal, maximum,
   and minimum values;" "each test of type x shall use live data;" "execution
   size and time shall be measured for each CSCI." Included shall be a
   statement of the extent of testing to be performed and rationale for the
   extent selected. The extent of testing shall be expressed as a percentage of
   some well defined total quantity, such as the number of samples of discrete
   operating conditions or values, or other sampling approach. Also included
   shall be the approach to be followed for retesting/regression testing.

..

.. testprogression:

Test progression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::

   In cases of progressive or cumulative tests, this paragraph shall explain
   the planned sequence or progression of tests.

..

.. _recordinganalysis:

Data recording, reduction, and analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::

   This paragraph shall identify and describe the data recording, reduction,
   and analysis procedures to be used during and after the tests identified in
   this STP. These procedures shall include, as applicable, manual, automatic,
   and semi-automatic techniques for recording test results, manipulating the
   raw results into a form suitable for evaluation, and retaining the results
   of data reduction and analysis.

..

.. _plannedtests:

Planned tests
-------------

.. todo::

   This paragraph shall be divided into the following subparagraphs to describe
   the total scope of the planned testing.

.. _itemstobetested_1:

(Item(s) to be tested)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::

    This paragraph shall identify a CSCI, subsystem, system, or other entity by
    name and project unique identifier, and shall be divided into the following
    subparagraphs to describe the testing planned for the item(s). (Note: the
    "tests" in this plan are collections of test cases. There is no intent to
    describe each test case in this document.)


.. _projectid_1:

(Project-unique identifier of a test)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo::

   This paragraph shall identify a test by project unique identifier and shall
   provide the information specified below for the test. Reference may be made
   as needed to the general information in 4.1.

   + Test objective
   + Test level
   + Test type or class
   + Qualification method(s) as specified in the requirements specification
   + Identifier of the CSCI requirements and, if applicable, software system
     requirements addressed by this test. (Alternatively, this information may be
     provided in Section 6.)
   + Special requirements (for example, 48 hours of continuous facility time, weapon
     simulation, extent of test, use of a special input or database)
   + Type of data to be recorded
   + Type of data recording/reduction/analysis to be employed
   + Assumptions and constraints, such as anticipated limitations on the test
     due to system or test conditions--timing, interfaces, equipment,
     personnel, database, etc.  Safety, security, and privacy considerations
     associated with the test

..

.. _projectid_2:

     associated with the test
