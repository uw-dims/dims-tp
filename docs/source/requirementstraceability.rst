Requirements traceability
=========================

Traceability to requirements in this document is done in
Section :ref:`testidentification` using ``intersphinx``
document linking as part of the `SR reference` line
in test descriptions. This creates hypertext links to
reference the requirements and/or user stories from the
appropriate sub-section(s) of Section :ref:`dimssr:requirements`
from the document :ref:`dimssr:dimssystemrequirements`,
like this:

    . . .

    #. Test levels: Component interface
    #. Test type or class: Expected value, simulated data, erroneous input, desk check
    #. Qualification method: Test
    #. SR reference: :ref:`dimssr:dwaUserStory7`
    #. Special requirements: Access to the DIMS JIRA tool
    #. Type of data to be recorded: Tester, Execution date, Status (Pass/Fail)
