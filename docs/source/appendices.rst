      rather than decimal numbering.

.. only:: html

   .. note:: Appendices in the HTML version are numbered, not designated by
      letters as in the PDF version. This is a limitation of Sphinx.


.. note:: TBD

   Appendices may be used to provide information published separately for
   convenience in document maintenance (e.g., charts, classified data).  As
   applicable, each appendix shall be referenced in the main body of the
   document where the data would normally have been provided.  Appendices may
   be bound as separate documents for ease in handling.  Appendices shall be
   lettered alphabetically (A, B, etc.).
